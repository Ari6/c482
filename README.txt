I have chosen "entering an inventory value that exceeds the minimum or maximum value for that part or product" from J1. (I guess that this means that ensuring an inventory value that exceeds the minimum or/and below the maximum value.)

I have chosen "ensuring that the price of a product cannot be less than the cost of the parts" from J2.
